        <!-- <h3>What is modern calligraphy?</h3>
        <p>Modern calligraphy is any calligraphy style that does not follow the fundamental rules of traditional
            calligraphy
            scripts such as Copperplate, Spencerian, Italic, Blackletter, etc. Modern calligraphy relies on certain
            principles of
            traditional calligraphy. However, it can provide you with more creative freedom.</p> -->
        <h3>What is Traditional calligraphy ?</h3>
        <p>Traditional calligraphy comes in a variety of hands, such as Copperplate and Spencerian. Each specific hand
            has its own
            set of rules, so it’s helpful to know which one you want to learn before getting started. The vast majority
            of our
            students get started with a Copperplate hand, and that’s the one we recommend starting with.</p>

        <p>Traditional is like it sounds, resembling the documents and styles of the past, beautifully.
            Our alphabets creation is due to the history of calligraphy. Contemporary can be modern scripts,
            experimental
            work,
            expressive and tends to be more personal, some might say artistic. It feels like “our time” vs. the past.
            Both use the alphabet, but can feel very different. This page is showing examples of traditional
            calligraphy.

        <p>Twenty-first-century calligraphers frequently create their own alphabets to reflect their personal aesthetics
            and
            personalities, using daring layouts and innovative materials, seeking inspiration in everything around
            them.BUT, we have to be careful though, as we ride this new wave, we still have to remember the rules that
            make letters
            legible and recognizable.
